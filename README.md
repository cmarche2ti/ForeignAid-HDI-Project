# ForeignAid-HDI-Project
This project was focused on answering the question if aid to foreign countries from the United States and the World Bank affected the country's Human Development Index.  Used data cleaning techniques with Pandas as well as visualizations with Matplotlib to try to understand the answer to this question. HDI is a measure of a country's overall achievement in economic and social dimensions. These dimensions inlcude health, education, per capita GDP, and others. Our conclusions were that there was little correlation between aid and HDI. There are many other factors besides need that go into which countries get aid from the US and the World Bank.
